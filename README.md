STAT157FINALPROJECT
===================

Post (and E-MAIL Kristina, Philip, and Aaron) your rough drafts for posters/ipython notebook by 9:30AM TUESDAY, December 10, 2013! We will be looking at them RIGHT at the start of our work session tomorrow.

Danielle will be filming your collaborative groups for the video. Notify her in class if you do NOT want to be filmed, and she will have a release form for those who participate.

For the science poster, please respond to Theresa's request:

Hi Stat 157,
We are putting together the Seismology Poster and want to include all of your awesome work. Please edit this google doc with text and image links that you want to be a part of the science poster. Please write as you want it to appear on the poster as we will not have time for major edits. Remember this is due right at the beginning of class tomorrow so the edits must be done soon.

Details from David Lau (with edits for clarification) about the faire and how to prepare:
"
Tuesday and Wednesday will be spent refining, formatting, etc. of submitted material, and it should all be finalized by Wednesday night at dead latest. This is highly discouraged, being analogous to submitting a rough draft for a term paper.

On Thursday, setup begins at 10:30 AM. It'll be in Sutardja-Dai hall (on campus, roughly between Evans and Soda Halls). It'll be an exhibition, with a bunch of tables in the common area. We'll be provided with two monitors that we can hookup to anything (laptops, probably) we please, and we'll have easels for our posterboards, of which we will have three (on the topics of science/seismology, reproducibility, and collaboration respectively). We'll probably want at least 3 people manning the table at all times. If I remember correctly, the faire runs at least until 2pm.

Adjacent to the table area is Banatao Auditorium. Inside, various speakers will be giving 3 minute speeches about their respective projects. We will want to field a speaker of our own to represent our class. However, the rest of us will be responsible for talking about our project as well, should people at the faire ask us questions, regardless of whether or not we're the ones actively standing post at our table.

In sum, what we need to produce:
One iPython notebook
2 Posters: Class management and reproducibility posters into 1 poster and 1 science poster
One 3-minute speaker
People to be available to present and answer questions at the tables in shifts
Everyone needs to be prepared to talk about the project on demand

Good luck, people.
